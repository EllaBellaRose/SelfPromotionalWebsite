                <h3>Field Work Experience</h3>
			    <p>When I completed work experince I worked in a digital marketing agency. I got to see how websites were made and even crafted one myself, this helped me gain the foundation of understanding for HTML and general website construction.</p>

             <h3>Teamwork Experience</h3>
          <p>Since 2017 I have been employed, as soon as I was old enough to wear a uniform and start the graft I did. Having a job at the youngest age possible for the company meant I have always had an impeccable work ethic. Hardwork is not something I shy away from and I certainly demonstrate this in my work. Working for so long also means I have learnt the importance of teamwork and can easily work with others but can aslo take on a leardership role when required.</p>
